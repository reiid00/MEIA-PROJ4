# Introduction

The current trend in the delivery industry has seen a rise in the use of couriers to deliver products, including food and retail items. The pandemic has accelerated this trend, as more people prefer to stay at home, increasing the need for delivery services. However, traditional delivery methods have their limitations, such as long delivery times, pollution from non-electric vehicles, traffic, and high costs, including delivery fees.

# How it would work 

The idea proposed is to incorporate a system of autonomous drones coordinated among themselves, without the need for an operator to control them, for the delivery of various services. This system can be applied to deliveries of pharmaceutical products, retail store products, including supermarkets, restaurants, and more. The drones are electric, which makes them much less polluting than traditional delivery vehicles, and are faster because they can bypass the limitations imposed by land routes, allowing them to make more deliveries in the same amount of time. Additionally, they can operate 24/7 autonomously, which can be a critical factor for some deliveries, such as pharmaceuticals and food.

In terms of the multi-agent system, each drone can be thought of as an agent, with a traffic control station responsible for managing their routes, optimizing them, and avoiding collisions, similar to air traffic control for airplanes, but at lower altitudes. The traffic control station can have one or more agents, possibly separated by zones, with bidirectional communication between the drones and the station. The drones would actively send information to the station about their current delivery status, location, etc., and the station would communicate the routes they need to follow, as well as any necessary adjustments to optimize the routes or avoid collisions.

Each drone would have its own characteristics, such as autonomy, maximum weight capacity, range, and speed. Different drones could be used for different types of deliveries, such as those requiring specific temperature conditions or for small, medium, and heavy deliveries. The company could also establish its own charging stations for the drones, with each station having a certain number of charging spots. Drones would communicate with a charging control station to request charging when needed. For example, if a drone anticipates ending its current delivery with only 17% battery life remaining, below the recommended minimum of 20%, and predicts it will take eight minutes to complete the delivery, it would notify the charging control station, which would analyze all available charging stations to determine which one can be allocated to charge the drone in question, based on the current occupancy of each charging station, remaining charging times of each drone currently charging, and the distance between the drone and the charging station.


# Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the proposed system of autonomous drones has the potential to revolutionize the delivery industry by being faster, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly than traditional delivery methods. The system's multi-agent architecture ensures that it can be adapted to different types of deliveries and optimized for maximum efficiency. Additionally, the use of electric drones reduces pollution and their ability to operate autonomously and 24/7 can provide critical time advantages in the delivery of essential goods, such as pharmaceuticals and food.
