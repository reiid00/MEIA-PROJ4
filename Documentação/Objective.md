# Introduction

The current trend in the delivery industry has seen a rise in the use of couriers to deliver products, including food and retail items. The pandemic has accelerated this trend, as more people prefer to stay at home, increasing the need for delivery services. However, traditional delivery methods have their limitations, such as long delivery times, pollution from non-electric vehicles, traffic, and high costs, including delivery fees.

The idea proposed is to incorporate a system of autonomous drones coordinated among themselves, without the need for an operator to control them, for the delivery of various services. This system can be applied to deliveries of pharmaceutical products, retail store products, including supermarkets, restaurants, and more. The drones are electric, which makes them much less polluting than traditional delivery vehicles, and are faster because they can bypass the limitations imposed by land routes, allowing them to make more deliveries in the same amount of time. Additionally, they can operate 24/7 autonomously, which can be a critical factor for some deliveries, such as pharmaceuticals and food.

# How it would work 

In terms of the multi-agent system, each drone can be thought of as an agent, with a traffic control station responsible for managing their routes, optimizing them, and avoiding collisions, similar to air traffic control for airplanes, but at lower altitudes. The traffic control station can have one or more agents, possibly separated by zones, with bidirectional communication between the drones and the station. The drones would actively send information to the station about their current delivery status, location, etc., and the station would communicate the routes they need to follow, as well as any necessary adjustments to optimize the routes or avoid collisions.

Each drone would have its own characteristics, such as autonomy, maximum weight capacity, range, and speed. Different drones could be used for different types of deliveries, such as those requiring specific temperature conditions or for small, medium, and heavy deliveries. The company could also establish its own charging stations for the drones, with each station having a certain number of charging spots. Drones would communicate with a charging control station to request charging when needed. For example, if a drone anticipates ending its current delivery with only 17% battery life remaining, below the recommended minimum of 20%, and predicts it will take eight minutes to complete the delivery, it would notify the charging control station, which would analyze all available charging stations to determine which one can be allocated to charge the drone in question, based on the current occupancy of each charging station, remaining charging times of each drone currently charging, and the distance between the drone and the charging station.

Regarding the collection process, we can assume that it is less sensitive since the goods will always be delivered by a dispatcher, whether it is from a restaurant, pharmacy, or any other establishment. Therefore, it is only necessary to explore how the storage of goods inside the drones is usually controlled and possibly use simple IoT sensors to help optimize this process, avoiding disruptions and collisions with humans and obstacles. On the other hand, the delivery process is naturally more sensitive because the drone is responsible for ensuring that it delivers the order to the correct recipient.

To address this, we will explore the use of QR codes. In our eventual mobile application, where customers will register their orders (or these will be integrated by other applications), a unique QR code will be generated for each order, which will allow for the validation of the recipient's identification. That is, when the drone arrives at a given destination, the customer will receive a notification that the order has arrived and only needs to point their phone with the QR code provided by the app at the time of delivery. Once the drone's camera scanner correctly validates the legitimacy of the QR code, the person will be able to collect their order.


# Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the proposed system of autonomous drones has the potential to revolutionize the delivery industry by being faster, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly than traditional delivery methods. The system's multi-agent architecture ensures that it can be adapted to different types of deliveries and optimized for maximum efficiency. Additionally, the use of electric drones reduces pollution and their ability to operate autonomously and 24/7 can provide critical time advantages in the delivery of essential goods, such as pharmaceuticals and food.
