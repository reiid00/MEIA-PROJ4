CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:65 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindTinyXML.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "TinyXML", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "TinyXML" with any
  of the following names:

    TinyXMLConfig.cmake
    tinyxml-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "TinyXML" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "TinyXML_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "TinyXML" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
